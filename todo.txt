Big Picture:
{
    [] On linux, it would require ELF and DWARF parser to get information like
	{
        - Source code line and machine code address mappings
            - Types and structs
            - Location of variables depending upon the current program counter
            - Function start and end addresses
            - Stack tracing
    }
    So we probably want to keep the parsing of ELF and DWARF separate as we develop so that it can be reused as a library.
    
        [] Platform specific controls would be required for controlling breakpoints. 
    I want the debugger interface to be independent of platform specific stuff like ptrace and ELF/DWARF symbols.
    
}

Todo:
{
    [] Assembly level:
    {
        [] Handling x86 and x64 properly ... ?
        [x] Breakpoints (on startup and given an address)
        [x] Continue
        [x] Step in
        [] Single-stepping(Step over): This would require parsing instruction opcodes for call instructions
        
        [x] Reading and writing registers
        [x] Reading memory
        [] Think of how to provide "write to memory" operation
        [] Command parsing, register name matching,etc are done in super slow fashion. Think of how to improve that
        [] Peek & Poke text can be improved
    }
